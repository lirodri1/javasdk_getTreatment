# Split Java SDK AWS lambda example

Input is a user id in JSON, as shown below.

```
{
  "userid": "dmartin"
}
```

# How to Build

Maven build "package" target for a "demo-1.0.0.jar" you can upload to the lambda in the AWS Management Console.

# Notes

Caches the Split client local to the container, so that only cold starts incur client construction.

Uses io.split.client 3.3.2 instead of latest 4.2.1 to allow dynamic feature refresh.
